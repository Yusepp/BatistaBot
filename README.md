# Misc.
This is my first time creating a discord bot, I started this project due to Groovy and Rythm shutdowns. At first I was trying to keep it as simple as possible and use it for my friends' server but people just asked me to add more features that those bots lacked (e.g. save queue to online playlist). Feel free to use my bot as template, free open source code rules!
